# Minesweeper in Yew

I wanted to create a sample front-end app with [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew). Based on [jgpaiva](https://github.com/jgpaiva/minesweeper)'s demo of a minesweeper app, I tried to make a clone of it by reading Yew's own examples and documentation.

The project can be run locally using [Trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk).
```
trunk serve
```
